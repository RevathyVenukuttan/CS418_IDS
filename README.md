## CS 418-Introduction to Data Sciences

**Lab exercises**: The folder contains all lab exercises performed during the coursework. Lab exercises include:
- Introduction to python with jupyter notebooks with basic operations, NumPy and Pandas packages
- Web-Scraping and API requests using BeautifulSoup and requests library
- Using SciKit-Learn machine learning packages on different datasets

**Homeworks**: The folder contains homeworks done during the coursework, which includes deploying KNN algorithm on Iris dataset and MNIST dataset and performing Exploratory Data Visualization (EDA) on Chicago Crimes dataset. 
The datasets can be downloaded from:
- IRIS data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
- MNIST train data: https://app.box.com/s/no1vmi8jovc9fhl9mbb6rekafcmxdm8x
- MNIST test data: https://app.box.com/s/j132icf1jsyag8o2ii1imdcnby5ag8fe
- Chicago crimes data: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

**Final Project**: 

Final project for the course was done on Credit Card Information dataset to classify the credit card clients of a Taiwan based bank into risky and non-risky based on the historic payment information. 

The dataset is available for download from the UCI Machine learning repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

An EDA was conducted initially on the data to understand how each variable varies and to identify if there are any correlations between the given variables. Several supervised and unsupervised learning techniques including 
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- KNN Classification
- RandomForest 

were then used on the dataset for identifying the defaulters and non-defaulters along with identifying the best technique based on model accuracy for such kind of a classification to avoid risks for the financial institution and aide them in making more informed decisions.
